### RDIG-006: Persist user selections to database

#### Description

Discipline and source selections are currently stored in the session only, which has a 120-minute default lifetime. Returning users must re-select their preferences every time the session expires. A simple persistence layer (e.g., a `user_preferences` table or key-value store) would allow selections to survive across sessions.

**Archived:** Database has been removed from the project entirely. The app is local-only, single-user, and uses file-based sessions. Session-based selections are sufficient for the current use case. If persistence becomes needed, a JSON config file approach would be more appropriate than a database.

### RDIG-011: Surface failed sources during digest generation

#### Description

Added a `$failures` array property to `DigestViewer` that tracks source label and error type (`fetch` or `summarize`) when catch blocks fire. An amber warning banner renders after generation completes, listing each failed source and its failure type. Disciplines with partial failures still show their successful sources. No new test files — covered by existing test suite and new Dusk tests (RDIG-013).

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Failed source fetches are tracked with source label and error type
- [x] Failed AI summarizations are tracked separately from fetch failures
- [x] User sees a warning after generation listing which sources failed
- [x] Disciplines with partial failures still show successful sources
- [x] Existing tests still pass

### RDIG-012: Cache AI summaries to avoid re-summarization

#### Description

Added a cache layer inside `AiSummarizer::summarizeItems()` keyed on `ai_summary:` + md5 of lowercase paper URL. Items with cached summaries are merged back without API calls. Cache TTL configurable via `AI_SUMMARY_CACHE_TTL` env var (default 24h, 0 disables). `forceRefresh` flag now passes through from DigestViewer to bypass both source and summary caches. Extracted `callProvider()` and `summaryCacheKey()` helper methods. 5 new cache tests added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AI summaries are cached keyed on paper URL (normalized)
- [x] Subsequent digest generations skip summarization for cached papers
- [x] Cache is bypassed when "Skip cache" is checked (same as source cache)
- [x] Cache TTL is configurable (separate from source cache TTL)
- [x] AI cost is reduced proportionally to cache hits
- [x] Existing tests still pass; new tests cover cache hit/miss behavior

### RDIG-013: Add Dusk tests for shipped features

#### Description

Created `tests/Browser/DigestFeaturesTest.php` with 9 Dusk test cases covering: export JSON button visibility/presence, skip cache checkbox presence/toggleability, progress status and digest-stream wire:stream elements, also_in badges for cross-listed papers, session lifetime warning text on both discipline and source pickers, and failure banner absence on successful generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Dusk test verifies Export JSON button appears after generation and triggers download
- [x] Dusk test verifies Skip cache checkbox is present and toggleable
- [x] Dusk test verifies progress status updates appear during generation
- [x] Dusk test verifies also_in badges render for cross-listed papers
- [x] All existing Dusk tests still pass

### RDIG-014: Rate-limit external API calls

#### Description

Added configurable inter-batch delay (`AI_BATCH_DELAY_MS`, default 200ms) via `usleep()` between AI summarization batches. All three AI providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama) now use Laravel HTTP `->retry(2, ...)` with exponential backoff that triggers specifically on 429 responses. Uses `throw: false` to avoid breaking existing placeholder-on-failure logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Configurable delay between AI summarization batches
- [x] 429 responses trigger exponential backoff with retry
- [x] Rate-limit behavior is logged for observability
- [x] Existing tests still pass

### RDIG-015: Add metadata envelope to digest JSON export

#### Description

Wrapped the exported digest JSON in a `{ meta, digest }` envelope. The `meta` object includes `generated_at` (ISO 8601), `format_version` (1), `disciplines` (list of selected discipline slugs), and `sources` (map of slug → selected source keys). Also writes to `storage/app/digests/` for local archival.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Exported JSON includes a `meta` object with `generated_at` timestamp
- [x] Meta includes list of selected disciplines and sources per discipline
- [x] Meta includes app version or format version marker
- [x] Existing digest array moves under a `digest` key
- [x] Existing tests still pass

### RDIG-016: Warn users about session lifetime

#### Description

Added help text below the save buttons on both discipline picker and source picker views. Text reads: "Selections are stored in your browser session and persist for N minutes of inactivity" where N is pulled from `config('session.lifetime')`.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Help text visible near discipline or source save buttons indicating session-based persistence
- [x] Text mentions approximate session duration
- [x] No functional changes to session behavior

### RDIG-017: Add config validation for sources and disciplines

#### Description

Created `tests/Unit/ConfigIntegrityTest.php` with 7 test cases: unique source keys, required fields on all sources, non-empty URLs, at least one discipline per source, all discipline references valid, all disciplines have labels, and all disciplines have boolean ready flags. Catches config errors at test time rather than runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Test asserts all source keys are unique
- [x] Test asserts all sources have required fields (key, url, label, disciplines)
- [x] Test asserts all discipline references in sources exist in disciplines config
- [x] All existing tests still pass

### RDIG-018: Add sources for Law and Arts disciplines

#### Description

Added LawArXiv (OSF Preprints, `lawarxiv_recent`) for Law and MediArXiv (OSF Preprints, `mediarxiv_recent`) for Arts. Both use the existing `fetchOsfPreprints` parser via `api.osf.io`. Set both disciplines to `ready=true`. Dusk isolation already covered by the existing `api.osf.io/*` Http::fake() stub. All 15 disciplines now active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] At least 1 source identified and configured for Law
- [x] At least 1 source identified and configured for Arts
- [x] Both disciplines set to `ready=true`
- [x] Dusk test isolation updated with canned responses for new sources

### RDIG-003: Stream digest generation with progressive UI

#### Description

Replaced the static loading spinner with Livewire 3's `$this->stream()` for progressive digest rendering. During generation, a status bar shows real-time updates ("Fetching arXiv — Mathematics…", "Summarizing arXiv — Mathematics…") and completed discipline sections appear immediately as they finish rather than waiting for the entire digest. Originally scoped as a queued job (RDIG-003 v1) but revised to streaming — no queue infrastructure needed for a local single-user app. Discipline section markup extracted into a reusable blade partial (`livewire/partials/digest-section.blade.php`). All 27 existing tests pass. Committed as `456aa49`.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Digest results stream to the UI progressively as each discipline/source completes
- [x] User sees which source is currently being processed
- [x] Full digest is available in session after generation completes (existing behavior preserved)
- [x] Existing tests still pass
- [x] No queue infrastructure required

### RDIG-008: Paper deduplication across sources

#### Description

Added per-discipline paper deduplication between fetch and summarize stages. Papers cross-listed in multiple arXiv subfields (e.g., `math.PR` and `math.ST`) now appear only once in the digest — under the first source that returned them. The first occurrence is annotated with `also_in` (a list of other source labels that had the same paper), displayed as small gray pill badges in the UI. New stateless `PaperDeduplicator` service with URL normalization (lowercase, http→https, trailing slash strip, arXiv version suffix strip). 25 unit tests covering normalizeUrl (null returns, transformations) and dedup (fast paths, core behavior, edge cases). DigestViewer refactored from sequential fetch-and-summarize to three-pass fetch-dedup-summarize loop. Sources fully emptied by dedup are skipped entirely, saving AI summarization budget.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Papers with identical URLs or arXiv IDs are deduplicated before AI summarization
- [x] Deduplicated items retain a reference to all sources they appeared in (`also_in` key)
- [x] AI summarization cost is reduced proportionally to duplicates removed
- [x] Digest display indicates when a paper appeared in multiple sources (gray pill badges)

### RDIG-002: Cache source fetch results

#### Description

Added a cache layer inside `SourcePreviewer::fetch()` that wraps all HTTP fetching. Cache key is `source_preview:` + md5 of URL + limit. TTL is configurable via `SOURCE_CACHE_TTL` env var (default 1 hour, 0 disables caching entirely). A `$forceRefresh` parameter bypasses cache in both the Livewire digest viewer (checkbox) and the source preview controller (`?fresh=1` query param). An `artisan source:clear-cache` command provides manual clearing. Five new unit tests cover cache hit, cache miss, force refresh, different-limit key isolation, and TTL=0 kill switch. All 27 tests pass. Committed as `0aeab73`.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Source fetch results are cached with a configurable TTL
- [x] Cache key includes source URL and limit parameter
- [x] Cached results are returned without HTTP requests on subsequent calls within TTL
- [x] Cache can be bypassed or cleared manually (artisan command + force-refresh flag + UI checkbox)
- [x] Existing tests still pass; new tests cover cache hit/miss behavior

### RDIG-007: Expand beyond single discipline

#### Description

Originally scoped as "expand to a second discipline." Exceeded scope: 30 new sources added across 12 disciplines, with 13 of 15 disciplines now `ready=true`. New parser methods (`fetchOsfPreprints`, `fetchEuropePmc`) support OSF Preprints and Europe PMC alongside existing arXiv and bioRxiv/medRxiv parsers. Http::fake() canned responses added for all new source types in Dusk environment. Completed in commit `ef07bee`.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Multiple disciplines set to `ready=true` in `config/disciplines.php`
- [x] Sources added for each ready discipline in `config/sources.php`
- [x] End-to-end digest generation works for new disciplines
- [x] New parsers added for OSF Preprints and Europe PMC
- [x] Dusk test isolation updated with canned responses for all source types

### RDIG-001: Document AI-specific environment variables in .env.example

#### Description

Added all 6 AI-provider environment variables to `.env.example` with descriptive comments. Also updated APP_NAME to Abstractly and switched all framework drivers to file-based/sync (removing database dependency entirely).

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `.env.example` includes all 6 AI-related env vars with placeholder values
- [x] Each variable has an inline comment explaining its purpose and default
- [x] `DIGEST_AI_PROVIDER` comment lists valid options (`gemini`, `openai`, `ollama`)

### RDIG-005: Add unit tests for SourcePreviewer and AiSummarizer services

#### Description

Added comprehensive unit tests for both core services. `SourcePreviewerTest` covers all 5 parser types (Atom, bioRxiv JSON, OSF JSON:API, Europe PMC JSON, RSS/Atom fallback) plus limit enforcement, empty feeds, and HTTP errors (12 test cases). `AiSummarizerTest` covers Gemini/OpenAI/Ollama happy paths, missing API keys, API failures, batch splitting, unknown provider fallback, and missing summary index placeholder (9 test cases). All tests use `Http::fake()` — no real external requests. Completed alongside the `config/ai.php` refactor in commit `90bce15`.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Unit tests exist for `SourcePreviewer` covering all 5 parser types (Atom, bioRxiv JSON, OSF JSON:API, Europe PMC JSON, RSS fallback)
- [x] Unit tests exist for `AiSummarizer` covering at least one provider's happy path and failure/placeholder path
- [x] HTTP calls are mocked (no real external requests in tests)
- [x] Tests run via `composer test` without additional setup
- [x] All new tests pass

### RDIG-010: Add digest JSON export

#### Description

Added an "Export JSON" action to the digest viewer. When clicked, the current digest is saved as a timestamped JSON file to `storage/app/digests/` and simultaneously downloaded via the browser. This provides a local archive of interesting digests without requiring a database. The export button is only visible when a digest has been generated and contains content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] "Export JSON" button visible on digest page when digest has content
- [x] Clicking export saves JSON to `storage/app/digests/{date}.json`
- [x] Clicking export triggers browser download of the same file
- [x] Export button hidden when no digest exists

### RDIG-004: Remove legacy controllers

#### Description

Deleted `DigestController` and `DisciplineController` from `app/Http/Controllers/`. Both were fully superseded by Livewire components (`DigestViewer`, `DisciplinePicker`, `SourcePicker`) and had zero route registrations, zero imports, and zero test references. Decision: delete entirely rather than relocate — no API endpoints are planned, and the logic has diverged enough from the Livewire implementations that they wouldn't serve as a useful starting point.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `DigestController` and `DisciplineController` removed from `app/Http/Controllers/`
- [x] No remaining imports or references to removed controllers
- [x] Decision rationale logged in PROGRESS.md

### RDIG-009: Standardize wire:navigate on all internal links

#### Description

Added `wire:navigate` to all 8 internal `<a>` links that were missing it. Three in the app layout (logo, Disciplines nav, Digest nav), one in the discipline picker (View digest button), three in the source preview page (two breadcrumbs + back button), and one in the source picker (Preview button — navigates to a traditional controller endpoint but `wire:navigate` still provides smoother transitions). All internal navigation now uses SPA-like page transitions consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All internal `<a>` links between Livewire-rendered pages include `wire:navigate`
- [x] Source preview link includes `wire:navigate` for smoother transitions (revised from original exclusion)
- [x] No regressions in navigation behavior
